# Manual | Voxette

This folder will  contain documents explaining how to  use the Voxette
voxel game  engine. This documentation is meant to be  user-facing and
thus shouldn't be too detailed.  For explanations of the internals and
how modules work, the [internals-folder](../internals/README.md) is to
be visited.
